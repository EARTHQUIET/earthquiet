          We know from history that technological innovations never came to
          humanity on their own, over time, someone has to work on it. Today,
          people are waking up. They came to a conscious existence. They notice
          the imperfections of our society and our environment, they want to do
          something with it. We need everyone to be a part of this innovation
          process and act. Look at us, the smartphone distracts us from the
          reality we live in. It prevents us from noticing that this reality
          remains surprisingly old-fashioned and imperfect. In our world, there
          are a lot of questions and problems that need to be addressed, upon
          which solutions will develop actively. Future is in our hands. The
          hand of human.

          Many people who have power and established systems are now busy making
          money. Money, that can be completely useless in that world which can
          fade away. We know, our Earth can degrade because of our ignorance and
          dellusion. Humanity is facing climate crisis, armed conflicts,
          corruption, overpopulation, hunger, disease, and much more of other
          problems that slowly but surely destroying us. We must pay attention
          to the problems that surround us and try to solve them. These
          decisions will serve the formation of a new world, a world that has
          overcome hunger, war and division.

          Most often, new technologies and cultural shifts are born in the
          depths of such startups. Sometimes world pay attention to fanatics of
          their craft, self-taught, enthusiasts, scientists, a minority. The
          most modern attempt to gather like-minded people in one place results
          in such a thing as startup. A startup is the largest group of people
          you can infect with your the idea. The main strength of the new
          company is in the ability to think in a new way. The small size of the
          firm allows employees to think freely, and this is an advantage that
          even more important than flexibility or adaptability.
        </p>
        <p>
          We created this platform to bring together innovators, visionaries,
          open-minded thinkers, scientists, fanatics, enthusiasts and just
          people who want to get to a better and brighter future. Go ahead,
          explore problems and ideas, communicate and find like-minded people,
          the future is in our hands, and we need to start today.
