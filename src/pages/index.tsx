            In a world with limited resources, globalization without new
            technologies are doomed. Technological innovations never came to
            mankind on their own, over time. We need all can become a part of
            this innovation processes. Take a look on us, smartphone distracts
            us from reality, we live in. It prevents us from noticing the fact
            that this reality remains surprisingly old-fashioned and imperfect.
            In our world there are a lot of issues that need solutions, active
            development and popularization. Yes, progress cannot be slowed down
            or even stopped, it exists outside of time, but it can be hurried.

            Most businesses are now busy making money. Money that can be
            completely useless, because the world we know may disappear. We face
            a climate crisis, overpopulation, hunger, diseases, and they are
            slowly destroying us. We must pay attention to issues which surround
            us, and try to resolve them. Most often, new technologies and
            solutions are born in the depths of start-ups, by fanatic
            scientists, a minority.

            in the ability to think in a new way: small size firm allows
