### EARTHQUIET

### Development Details
Here I've used Next.js to add more complexity and SSR to standard React <br>
I am using Hygraph as Headless CMS for Articles and Posts <br>
GraphCMS allows to access API via GraphQL, which of course I used <br>
Also, I decided to add TypeScript to the table to make code more predictable <br>
